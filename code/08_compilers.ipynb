    "Let's recall that an OpenMP program consists of:\n",
    "1. Compiler directives that generate parallel code\n",
    "2. Library calls to configure runtime\n",
    "  a. Need to `#include <omp.h>` to get symbols/functions\n",

    "The goal is to develop __fast__ and parallel code.  OpenMP makes it parallel. Compilers make it fast.  They perform things like:\n",
    "  * loop unrolling\n",
    "  * inline functions\n",
    "  * branch prediction\n",
    "  * vectorization\n",
    "These can effect performance by __large constant factors__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of optimization is specified at compile time.  It is typical to debug unoptimized code and deploy optimized code.  In gcc/g++:\n",
    "  * -O0 (default) = Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.\n",
    "  * -O1 = simple optimizations that donâ€™t take a lot of compile time\n",
    "  * -O2 = rewrite loops, follow jump pointers, inline small functions, no time/space tradeoffs\n",
    "  * -O3 = vectorize, inline functions, branch prediction\n",
    "  * and, -g include debugging symbols\n",
